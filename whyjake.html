    <p>In an ever-evolving age of “new,” smartphones and social media dependency have been on the rise. Social media’s original intention was to connect us but has ultimately separated us further from each other. This newsletter comes to you to lessen your dependency on this isolating technology. We aim to move away from these vices and support those choosing to use the “dumb phone.” Using email rather than social media, this newsletter will supply information on events as well as updates on the music scene within SLO and the central coast. Without social media, you risk missing out on real social events, but this newsletter will allow you to skip the FOMO and stay in the loop of everything going on in the scene.</p>
    <p>This newsletter will update you about shows, gigs, concerts and other events. It will also feature concert reviews, artist spotlights, weekly jokes, and more.</p>
